# Google-Keep-React

This project is a clone of google keep, it aims to showcase some of my skills in front end development focusing on:

* React and its ecosystem
* ECMAScript 2015-2017 features
* Functional Programming
* Browser event handling
* Performance
* Accesibility

I will be working almost daily on this project, as I am currently looking for a 6 month internship. (Check my personal GitHub
page if you are interested in collaboration).

The codebase is full of comments explaining techniques I use, I created several tags to make it easier for employers to check specific things:

I also keep a [development diary](https://github.com/cristidrg/Google-Keep-React/tree/master/developmentdiary) where I describe various tasks I do.

I highly suggest playing with the app for five minutes before jumping into the tags, as I will be refering to the certain components and functionality in my tags.

Installation

Simply download the project, run `npm install` and then run `npm run dev`. The project runs on http://localhost:9000/

I chose to simply clone an existing app rather than creating something new because I wanted to have the requirements and
design already pinned down to focus on development. 

Current Tasks:
 - Implement a basic CRUD back end for notes
 - Implement note tagging
 - Implement history and routes
 ... TBD
